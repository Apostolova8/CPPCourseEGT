/*Use the Package inheritance hierarchy created in Lecture
“Inheritance” to create a program that displays the address
information and calculates the shipping costs for several
Packages.
The program should contain a vector of Package pointers to
objects of classes TwoDayPackage and OvernightPackage.
Loop through the vector to process the Packages
polymorphically.
For each Package, invoke get functions to obtain the
address information of the sender and the recipient, then
print the two addresses as they would appear on mailing
labels.
Also, call each Package's calculateCost member function
and print the result.
Keep track of the total shipping cost for all Packages in the
vector, and display this total when the loop terminates.
