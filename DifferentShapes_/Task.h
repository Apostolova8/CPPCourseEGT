/*
Implement the Shape hierarchy designed in Lecture "Inheritance"

Each TwoDimensionalShape should contain function getArea to
calculate the area of the two-dimensional shape.

Each ThreeDimensionalShape should have member functions
getArea and getVolume to calculate the surface area and volume
of the three-dimensional shape, respectively.

Create a program that uses a vector of Shape pointers to
objects of each concrete class in the hierarchy.
The program should print the object to which each vector element points.

Also, in the loop that processes all the shapes in the vector
determine whether each shape is a TwoDimensionalShape or a ThreeDimensionalShape.

If a shape is a TwoDimensionalShape, display its area.
If a shape is a ThreeDimensionalShape, display its area and volume.
