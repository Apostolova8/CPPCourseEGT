/*
Polymorphism: Implement a function printArea() that takes a pointer to the
base class Shape as an argument and calls a method area() that should be defined
in both derived classes Circle and Rectangle. The area() method should return the
area of the shape, assuming Circle has an attribute radius and Rectangle has width
and height.*/
